        <div class="row clearfix">

          <div class="col-xs-12">

            <p>I knew, when I was in high school, that I wanted to make things on the Internet.  I didn’t know if it would be interactive design like Flash or Director or if I would go into web design/dev but I knew I wanted to make digital things to share with the world.  I studied web design and development in college and graduated with a BS in Interactive Media Design. Where some of my peers headed down the, albeit short, path of action scripting and Flash - I fell in love with PHP & JavaScript.</p>
 
            <p>Since then I’ve worked on in-house products such as BobVila.com, Chitika.com, Goby.com, Scout.me, AuditAnalytics.com. I also spent time at agencies building sites for law firms, credit unions, intranets and early 00’s attempts at niche social media sites. More than anything I have always enjoyed working on a product that I understand. Whether it’s the domain knowledge, customer or user that I understand, once I have a hold on that I know who and how my product needs to serve someone.</p>
             
            <h3>But do you even open source?</h3>
            <p>I love open source technology, don’t get me wrong. But I haven’t done much work committing to open source because I enjoy exploring my own curiosity with my free time/fun time development. A few times in my career I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where if we start down an interesting path and another interesting opportunity comes up we are able to pivot and check it out and that’s what I like my free-time development to be like.  If my role is to close out tickets and be a feature factory 9-5/m-f then my free time development needs to be as fluid, flexible and forgiving as the tide rolling in on a perfect summer day.</p>
             
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
             
            <p>I do stuff other than make web things. I bullet journal (BUJO), which is a note taking/journaling style that helps me keep my personal life organized and is a technique I apply to the jobs I’m doing as well. I took up quilting in 2011 because years of making digital products without having a physical manifestation of something to hold in my hands and show for all that work started to wear on me. Having always been a crafty person and loved sewing the math and problem solving involved in quilt designing and piecing really fit well. I’ve always enjoyed photography and had spent and getting outdoors as well. I spent a few summers second shooting weddings and shooting concepts for model portfolio development. Maybe you’ll see me hiking a trail taking scenic photos or paddling my pink kayak down a waterway near yo.! If you do, be sure to wave and say hello!</p>
